# africastalking
## What it does
This is an Africastalking API wrapper in Golang.

> This is a project is still in dev, though working parts
> should be ok.

## Why is it useful
- Trying to make it easier to use with all the parameter being close by.
- Could better help people learn more about golang 'net/http' package as it heavily uses this package.
- Also helps make very fast application(hope so :P compiled source should be faster) with the beauty of concurrency.
